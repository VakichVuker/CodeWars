# 1. Sum without highest and lowest number
Task file:
* high_and_low.py

### Task
Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).
The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.
Mind the input validation.

### Example
{ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6

### Input validation
If an empty value ( null, None, Nothing etc. ) is given instead of an array, or the given array is an empty list or a list with only 1 element, return 0.

# 2. Find the position!
Task file:
* find_pos_alph.py

### Task
When provided with a letter, return its position in the alphabet.

Input :: "a"

Ouput :: "Position of alphabet: 1"
